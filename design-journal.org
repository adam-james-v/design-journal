* Design Journal
A project for iterating on design ideas and projects. It's a mixed bag of whatever I want to work on, to varying degrees of completeness. As designs solidify, they may be sliced out and moved to their own dedicated projects.

* Tech and Tools
Use Forge CLJ library for the most part. Use SVG-CLJ and CLJS projects for interactive sites as examples and configurator front ends too.

Connect Forge with OpenSCAD for ease of iteration and distribution.
Connect Forge with FreeDAD for better support of 'real engineering' workflows.

* Goals
Use this to keep my design and engineering skills and habits up to date. Consider this to be a place for deliberate practice.

Also, I want to use design, tech, and engineering to (potentially) help with solving climate crisis problems. I can't do it all, but I can't accept the status quo and am compelled to do something. This is a 'scratchpad' start to that sort of thinking.
